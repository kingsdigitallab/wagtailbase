Communities across \r\nEngland, Scotland and Wales staged theatrical re-enactments of events from local and \r\nnational history with thousands of men, women and children involved as performers, \r\norganizers and spectators. This was national costume drama on a grand scale. Over the \r\ncourse of the twentieth century many hundreds of events were mounted by communities and \r\ninstitutions, ranging from small churches and village communities to large cities such as \r\nLiverpool and Manchester.</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.historicalpageants.ac.uk/about/\">Read more about the project </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p><p class=\"inner\">\n<h3>We need your help!</h3>\n<p>Do you have any materials relating to historical pageants?</p>\n<p>Interested in helping shape the direction of the Historical Pageants website?</p>\n<p>\n<a class=\"button round home-page-cta\" href=\"http://www.historicalpageants.ac.uk/get-involved/\">GET INVOLVED</a>\n</p>\n</p>\n"

Our project will reveal the stories that communities and\r\n institutions told about themselves. It will result in a comprehensive \r\ndatabase of historical pageants, a major book, articles, and an edited \r\nvolume of essays situating the British movement in its international \r\ncontext.</p>\n<p>A key feature of the project will be a publicly-accessible website. \r\nThis will include general commentary on the pageant movement, \r\nrepresentative images of pageant-related ephemera, and oral testimonies \r\nfrom witnesses to historical pageants. It will enable individual users \r\nand local history societies to contribute their own memories and \r\nmemorabilia.</p>"
